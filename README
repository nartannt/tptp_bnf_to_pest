This project aims to generate a .pest file from the official TPTP bnf specifications (https://tptp.org/TPTP/SyntaxBNF.html)

It directly prints out the pest grammar. To use it change the filename in the main.rs file to wherever your bnf file is stored.

A handful of caveats:
   - The program completely ignores semantic rules
   - I have been unable to find a precise semantic of grammar, and relied on guesswork for some of the specifics
   - There are likely a couple of bugs I haven't caught, the grammar I wrote is not very robust
   - Additionnal modifications must be made to the generated pest file
      * remove the "null" rule and replace all instances of "null" with the question mark and appropriate parenthesing
        haven't found a way to work around this cleanly (maybe instead have a null = {&ANY} rule?)
      * replace all oct ascii values with hex ascii values :
          do_char = { ( '\x20'..'\x21' | '\x23'..'\x5B' | '\x5D'..'\x7E' | ( "\\" ) ~ ( "\"" | "\\" ) ) }
          sq_char = { ( '\x20'..'\x26' | '\x28'..'\x5B' | '\x5D'..'\x7E' | ( "\\" ) ~ ( "'" | "\\" ) ) }
       automisable without too much work but can't be bothered
      * fix all left-recursive rules
        possibly automisable but would take more effort than it's worth
      * fix non-terminating rules (exactly not_star_slash)
        don't think this can be automised

With this in mind, the recommended use of this project is to generate the pest file using this code and then manually modify it.

The tptp.pest file has been generated and subsequently modified by hand, it successfully parsed COM001_10.
